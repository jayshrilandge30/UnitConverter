# Unit Converter

This project is a versatile unit converter application developed using Java. It supports conversion between various popular unit types and leverages several modern libraries and tools such as `Swing`, `Jackson 2.17.2`, `Maven 3.9.8`, and `Java 22`. The application remembers the last used conversion settings and automatically restores them at startup.
